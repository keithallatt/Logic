Otherwise, we create conjunctions, disjunctions, material implications, material equivalence, and negations of the expanded node with any of the previously expanded nodes, and provided the length of the string representation is not larger than the length of the string representation of the proposition we start with, we add it to the list of propositions to be expanded upon. \n"
